      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is an epic action-drama set in the fictional,
      dystopian city-state of Khansaar, a world governed by its own brutal laws
      and warring tribes. The complex narrative centers on the deep, fraught
      bond between two childhood friends, Deva (Prabhas) and Vardharaja Mannar
      (Prithviraj Sukumaran), that ultimately turns them into formidable
      adversaries. The story unfolds when Vardharaja, the prince of Khansaar,
      faces a planned coup d'état by his father's ministers and relatives who
      all vie for control of the throne. To consolidate his power and survive
      the political turmoil, he leaves the city and seeks out his long-lost
      friend, Deva, who has been living a quiet life as a simple man for years.
      Bound by an old promise, Deva returns to Khansaar to help Vardharaja
      secure his position as the undisputed ruler, unleashing his incredibly
      violent and formidable nature in a series of high-octane battles. As the
      film progresses, it delves into the intricate history of Khansaar's
      various tribes, political conspiracies, and a major twist concerning
      Deva's true identity: he is actually Devaratha Raisaar, the son of the
      leader of the Shouryaanga tribe, the rightful heir to the throne, whose
      people were massacred years ago. The first part ends as Vardharaja, now
      aware of Deva's lineage and potential claim, declares him his "Salaar"
      (commander) while setting the stage for the inevitable conflict and power
      struggle in the announced sequel,
